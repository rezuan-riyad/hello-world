Hello, I am riyad and changes are done by me.

#gravity
The value of gravity on Earth is nearly 9.8 m/s
It is only the gravity which helps something to come back to the ground.

#projectil-motion
For a free falling/moving body (anything like a projectile), there will be no other force
faced by the object than gravity. That is the reason why the horizontal component of velocity
remain constant.
